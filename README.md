# Millora Connect

Millora Connect is a premier B2B online marketplace designed to bridge the gap between customers and manufacturers in the hardware prototyping industry.

3. **Negotiation & Finalization**: Customers review bids from manufacturers, negotiate for the best offer, and finalize the contract.

### Manufacturer Journey
1. **Project Discovery**: Manufacturers view a dashboard of visible projects matching their capabilities.
2. **Bidding**: Manufacturers place bids specifying price and estimated delivery dates.
3. **Execution**: Upon acceptance, manufacturers proceed with production.
